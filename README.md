### Hi there 👋

 👨‍💻 I’m a software engineer from Skopje, Macedonia with a passion for computers, programming and designing and developing distributed systems.
 
 In my free time, I love working on open-source software, programming in Go as well as dabbling with the latest tools and technologies, and testing new stuff out on my pet projects. I am also a competitive gamer. 
 
 🔭 I’m currently working @ InPlayer as Backend Engineer
